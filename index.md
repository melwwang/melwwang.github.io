## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 2 
  Lab 2 was my favorite because in the lab we learned about strings, prompting the program, the compiler, and the character spacing position in the line. If the line was too long, we needed to use our own judgement on where to break up the line and wrap it. A good place to wrap the line is at the insertion operators. Operators are a good place to break up a line. We got to see the code printed out after all the steps were taken.  

Lab 5 
  Lab 5 was my favorite because we learned about modular programming, converting integers into doubles, and doing a lint check, where different elements of our programs are defined in different files. Since trying to add all the files into one file would be too large, programmers like to break their programs down into multiple files and break them down into independent places which can be tested independently. The lint check helps to make the necessary steps to correct the program. We were able to write a program that calculated the length and width of a rectangle. The second part, we were able to write a program that converted measurements into decimals to feet, inches, and eights of inches.  

Lab 8 
  Lab 8 was my favorite because it was a bit challenging. The first part of the activity was the program that involved writing a function that computes the average mean of all elements of a vector except the minimum and the maximum. The program then computes the maximum, the minimum, the sum from both, and can compute the average by dividing the sum of the number of elements minus two. The second part, we learned about loops where we made a pattern out of them using the concept of a knitting machine.
